### One-Time Setup:
1.  **Sync your code** to your GitHub repository.
2.  On GitHub.com, go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
3.  Set **Build and deployment** to "Deploy from a branch".
4.  Select the `main` branch and `/(root)` folder.
5.  Click **Save**.
6.  Open the provided URL on your phone (Chrome/Vivaldi/Safari).

### Installing as an App:

## 💾 Data Sovereignty
BeanLog does not use a cloud database. Your logs are stored strictly within your browser's **Local Storage**. 
-   Use the **Data Vault** (Database icon) regularly to export `.json` backups.
-   Clear browser data will wipe your logs—always keep a recent backup in your cloud drive of choice!
