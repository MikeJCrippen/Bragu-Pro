## 💾 Data Sovereignty
Bragu Pro does not use a cloud database. Your logs are stored strictly within your browser's **Local Storage**. 
-   Use the **Data Vault** (Database icon) regularly to export `.json` backups.
-   Clear browser data will wipe your logs—always keep a recent backup in your cloud drive of choice!
